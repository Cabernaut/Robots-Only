In battle, you’ll have several options:
Attack: Perform a physical attack.

Defend: Reduce incoming damage from enemies.
Use Item: Access your inventory to use health or mana potions.
Allies (if you recruit them) will also assist you in battle.

Certain choices will influence your journey, including the option to befriend or fight enemies, leading to different endings based on your actions and performance.
Tips
Use each class's strengths to your advantage; for example, Mages should leverage spells, while Warriors may benefit from direct attacks.
Conserve items and spells for difficult fights, especially against bosses.
Remember to manage your HP and MP effectively; resting and using items at the right times will keep you prepared for upcoming encounters.
Enjoy the Adventure!
